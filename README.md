# Plant-Propagation-Algorithm-for-NSP
This is my own proposition of how to solve the Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP) based on an adaptation of the Plant Propagation Algorithm PPA also known as the Strawberry algorithm. 
This code is the result of my dissertation of my Post-degree in Statistics and Operational Research. This is a metaheuristic algorithm part of the family of the Natural Inspired Algorithms (NIA), 
this adaptation was proposed by me Omar Garcia in July 2019, for the Math Research Department in the University of Essex. UK.
